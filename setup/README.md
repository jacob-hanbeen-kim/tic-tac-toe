# Packages

We will be using multiple python packages throughtout this class, here are some of them:

*jupyter - interactive notebook (you will learn more about them soon)
*numpy - a package for scientific computing (multi-dimensional array manipulation)
*matplotlib - a plotting library
*networkx - a package for manipulating networks/graphs
*pandas - a package for data analysis
*pgmpy - library for probabilistic graphical models
You can see the complete list of packages and required versions in ./requirements.txt.

We can install all these packages using command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Please navigate to `setup/` directory, activate your environment (`conda activate python_env`), then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installed, you can run `pip freeze` to see the list of all of the packages installed in your ai_env environment.

# Jupyter

Now that you have setup the environment it's time to learn more about the jupyter notebooks.

We have already installed jupyter, to open it up you can run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

It will start a python kernel which you can assess via https://localhost:8888 in your browser.
